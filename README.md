**Project Title:** Brain Tumor Prediction

**Project Description:**
The Brain Tumor Prediction project is aimed at developing an efficient machine learning system to accurately predict brain tumors. This involved analyzing four different algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These algorithms were assessed to determine the most effective one for the dataset.

Furthermore, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was implemented specifically for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. Through extensive experimentation and refinement, the CNN model achieved an impressive 11% accuracy improvement compared to traditional machine learning algorithms.

Key aspects of the project include the utilization of statistical feature selection techniques, data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy, and visualization of results with Matplotlib. The project aims not only to develop accurate prediction models but also to gain insights into the factors influencing tumor classification.
